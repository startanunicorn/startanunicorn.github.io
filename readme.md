## About

### Start a Unicorn teaches you to think algorithmically *before* writing code.

Start a Unicorn provides a structured learning path for individuals driven by technology but lacking traditional tech education. We focus on building a strong foundation in algorithmic thinking *before* diving into code. This approach, often overlooked, is the key to becoming a truly versatile and adaptable tech professional.

Many aspiring developers are intimidated by the complexity of coding. They jump into learning syntax without understanding the underlying principles of problem-solving. This leads to frustration and a feeling of being "stuck." We solve this by focusing on the *fundamentals* first.
